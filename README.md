# WoW Talent Parser

A parsing utility to be used alongside [Talent Extractor](https://github.com/snakybo/TalentExtractor). It's able to parse the raw class, specialization, and talent data, and produce a usable, common interface for accessing it.

## Installation

This tool requires [Python 3](https://www.python.org/).

## Usage

Copy the talent data generated by the [Talent Extractor](https://github.com/snakybo/TalentExtractor) addon at the `WTF/Account/YOUR ACCOUNT/SavedVariables/TalentExtractor.lua` into the same folder as the Python script, afterwards, run run the appropriate `parse_*.bat`) script.

The script will generate a file called `TalentData*.lua` which can be embedded inside of other addons.

The output of the talent data Lua files is configured to be ingested by [LibTalentInfo](https://github.com/snakybo/LibTalentInfo).
